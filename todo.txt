query of a user should be done in url link
if it doesn't exist, return a sorry we couldn't find this user

navigation bar -- note need to possibly automate changes for links in navbar
figure out login system -- might be okay to always join signed out

for topics page, figure out how to load all topic content

make sure there is a route for all views

register page? --> (when user opens page)
register --> homepage
sign out button?

registered page for when user has registered -> almost done

add a way to validate if the username isn't found or password is incorrect
